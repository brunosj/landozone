I always find it interesting to see what tools people use, here are mine if you are curious.

### Utilities

- **Rectangle**: one of my favorite app for Mac is [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), a window manager that allows you to easily manage your windows and workspaces I'm always moving between VS Code, terminal, browser windows, etc. and this tool helps me do it rapidly and sharply.
- **DeepL**: by now everyone knows about [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/macos-app), but I strongly recommend having the desktop app installed since it allows you to copy text to the clipboard and translate it with a single shortcut.
- **Toggl Track**: I use this simple [time tracker](https://toggl.com/) to keep track of my working hours, it has a very simple interface and a lot of useful tools pre-installed.

### Web dev tools

- **Cursor**: Cursor paired with [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/en/chat-with-claude) is my favorite pair for coding and makes my life a lot easier.
- **Uptime Kuma**: this is a simple self-hosted [monitoring tool](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) for your websites and servers. It can be installed in minutes and provides a very simpleinterface to keep an eye on your sites.
